		<h3>Why Try Psychotherapy?</h3>
		<p>
			If you are considering going to therapy you are likely recognizing distress in your life, are interested in learning more about yourself, and are ready to invest in a healing process that will last. Your options include seeking medication for short-term symptom relief, addressing the root of the issue in psychotherapy, or a combination of both.
