	<p>I have earned a PsyD from the University of Denver and am working as a psychologist candidate at Dandelion Psychology, LLC. I have five years of clinical experience working with various populations, including divorcing families, young adults with developmental delays, families in private practice, and two years at Kaiser Permanente. I am a certified family mediator, discernment counselor, and canine assisted therapist. I use an integrative psychodynamic approach to psychotherapy in order to help clients better understand themselves within their life context. I seek to aid in the understanding and processing of emotional reactions to life experiences, as well as how they impact choices, behavior and contribute to patterns of thinking,. Part of this process involves identifying values and motivations for change. I have a relational focus, as those around us tend to impact our view of ourselves and influence our patterns of interaction. When needed, I also can provide psychoeducation as well as coping skills for navigating difficult emotionally charged moments.</p>

	<h2>Specialty</h2>
	
	<p>In addition to my training, I have a personal interest in the human-animal bond and ways in which animals can benefit humans both physically and psychologically. For example, one concept in particular that seems to apply both to humans and canines is attachment theory. There is an important social component to survival, and humans and dogs seem to display similar attachment patterns with caregivers. Thus, I chose to integrate my professional training with my interest in animal assisted therapy. I trained my own puppy as a therapy dog, and she has been aiding me in a clinical setting for the past two years. As my final doctoral requirement, I created a treatment model for families incorporating a dog and integrating Jane Nelsonâ€™s Positive Discipline parenting approach. This is called the Canine Assisted Family Therapy (CAFT) model, and is awaiting publication.</p>

	<p>AAT has been shown to reduce cortisol, blood pressure, heart rate, anxiety, and physical pain, as well as to increase focus, relaxation, motivation, oxytocin, cardiovascular health, and encourage communication, bonding, and comfort. A therapy animal can be a vital part of a treatment team, help to facilitate growth for the client in many ways, and can improve treatment outcomes.</p>
