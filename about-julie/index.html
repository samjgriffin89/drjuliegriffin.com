<section class="about-content">
	<p>Hi! My name is Lexi Waffles and my birthday is November 18th, 2013. This year I will be 4 years old. I am a Wavy Coated Golden Retriever and I went to a lot of school to become a certified therapy dog. My mom is Julie Melowsky Griffin, PsyD, and she has gone to a lot of school also! She helped me to learn manners and pass my Canine Good Citizen Test. Mom got certified to use Canine Assisted 
	Interventions while I got certified as a Therapy Dog. Together, we make a certified Animal Assisted Therapist and Certified Therapy Dog team through Pawsitive Therapeutic Interventions, LLC.</p>

	<p>Once we had our qualifications it was time to start working. We worked as a team for 6 months at a private practice providing therapy to children and families and then Mom completed her internship at Kaiser Permanente. I only had to work one day a week, because I was still a puppy and had a lot of energy. Mom graduated in 2017 from DU with her doctorate in clinical psychology, and now we are both ready to work!</p>

	<p>I love meeting new people, and I hope to get to know you better as we spend time together. I can be shy or cautious sometimes, and I need a little time to make sure we can trust each other. Please learn to read my body language so we can communicate well and be friends. I am incredibly gentle and obedient, and I love to learn. Mom likes taking me to work so that she can develop her skills working with you and me together. Here is some information about what we do, and how hanging out with me can help you in therapy:</p>

	<p><q>“Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) is an umbrella term for diverse therapeutic approaches, used with people of all ages (from children to the elderly), in which an animal is an integral part of the treatment process. AAT involves interactions in the therapy room between a client, an animal (usually a dog), and a therapist, with the aim of improving therapeutic outcomes” (Zilcha-Mano, Mikulincer, & Shaver, 2011).</q></p>

	<p>There are many benefits from having a dog in therapy, and they can assist with targeting the specific concerns you bring up in our initial interview. Research has shown that interacting with an animal in therapy can increase motivation, engagement, speed of progress, and treatment outcomes. Among other things, you can develop better impulse control, emotion regulation, empathy, and problem solving skills, as well as how to ask for what you want or need calmly yet assertively. I hope that you will be agreeable to allowing me to be part of your therapy sessions. Here are some things you can learn to do:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Read Lexi’s body language correctly so that you can learn to communicate effectively and prevent any fear or injury to anyone present. (Video: Dog Language)</li>
		<li>Understand rules and risks. Julie will be setting limits to prioritize everyone’s safety.</li>
		<li>Learn how to act in a way that shows Lexi that you are reliably trustworthy by showing respect and not startling or injuring her.</li>
	</ul>
