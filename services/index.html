		<h3 class="text-center">Individual Psychotherapy</h3>

		<h4 class="blue-text">Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</h4>
		<p>
			A form of psychotherapy that focuses on modifying dysfunctional emotions, behaviors, and thoughts by interrogating and uprooting negative or irrational beliefs. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognitive-behavioral-therapy">Click for more information</a>
		</p>

		<h4 class="tangerine-text">Psychodynamic therapy</h4>
		<p>
			Similar to psychoanalytic therapy in that it is an in-depth form of talk therapy based on the theories and principles of psychoanalysis. But psychodynamic therapy is less focused on the patient-therapist relationship, because it is equally focused on the patient’s relationship with his or her external world. Often, psychodynamic therapy is shorter than psychoanalytic therapy with respect to the frequency and number of sessions, but this is not always the case. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/psychodynamic-therapy">Click for more information</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Makes assumptions about how the mind works that are based on psychoanalytic theory, but the technique is radically different from a traditional psychoanalysis treatment. It is brief – 15 sessions would not be unusual – and often similar in number of sessions to CBT. It is mostly delivered once per week and takes place face-to-face. ~ Monitor on psychology p. 45, Amy Novotney

		<h4 class="coral-text">Self-Psychology</h4>
		<p>
			Recognizing empathy as an essential aspect of the therapeutic process of addressing human development and gflex-rowth.   The therapist helps people consider how their early experiences may contribute to the formation of their sense of self. <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/self-psychology">Click for more information</a>
		</p>

		<h4 class="blue-text">Trauma Focused CBT (TF-CBT)</h4>
		<p>
			As its name implies is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy that addresses the specific emotional and mental health needs of children, adolescents, adult survivors, and families who are struggling to overcome the destructive effects of early trauma. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is especially sensitive to the unique problems of youth with post-traumatic stress and mood disorders resulting from abuse, violence, or grief. Because the client is usually a child, TF-CBT often brings non-offending parents or other caregivers into treatment and incorporates principles of family therapy. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/trauma-focused-cognitive-behavior-therapy">Click for more information</a>

		<h4 class="tangerine-text">Emotion Focused Therapy (EFT)</h4>
		<p>
			Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) is a short-term form of therapy that focuses on adult relationships and attachment/bonding. The therapist and clients look at patterns in the relationship and take steps to create a more secure bond and develop more trust to move the relationship in a healthier, more positive direction. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/emotionally-focused-therapy">Click for more information</a>

		<h4 class="coral-text">Couples Intensive Workshops – Marriage Retreats</h4>
		<p>
			All Denver Connections retreats are uniquely designed for only one couple at a time. These 1 or 2-day intensive sessions are generally scheduled over the weekend, starting on a Friday or Saturday. Couples are encouraged to participate in follow up couples counseling after the initial workshop.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Connections approach to relationship distress is based on the new science of love and attachment. Research studies reveal how our brains are hard-wired for a deep level of emotional connection to others. During childhood, most of us tend to learn ineffective responses to relationship conflict and emotionally upsetting experiences. In our adult relationships, we are triggered emotionally when we don’t feel safely connected, and when our needs aren’t met. Our partners react to our distress, and this sets up an endless spiral of negative reactivity that includes conflict, distance, or both. <a href="https://www.rcosf.com/marriage-retreats-denver/">Click for more information</a>
		</p>

		<h4 class="blue-text">Discernment Counseling</h4>
		<p>
			A type of brief couples therapy designed for couples who are uncertain about whether to continue or end their relationship. It is often used when one partner wants to end the relationship while the other hopes to preserve it. The aim of therapy is to help both partners consider all options before they make the decision to work on or terminate the relationship. <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/discernment-counseling">Click for more information</a>

		<h3 class="text-center">Parent Coaching with Positive Discipline</h3>
		<p>
			Positive Discipline teaches young people from an early age to become responsible, respectful, and resourceful members of their communities. Based on the best-selling Positive Discipline parenting books by child psychologist Dr. Jane Nelsen, Positive Discipline teaches important social and life skills in a manner that is deeply respectful and encouraging for both children and parents. Recent research tells us that children are hardwired from birth to connect with others, and that children who feel a sense of connection to their community, family, and school are less likely to misbehave. Positive Discipline is based on the understanding that the key to positive parenting is not punishment, but mutual respect. <a href="https://www.positivediscipline.com/">Click for more information</a>

		<h3 class="text-center">Family Therapy</h3>
		<p>
			Family therapy or family counseling is designed to address specific issues that affect the psychological health of the family, such as major life transitions or mental health conditions. It may be used as the primary mode of treatment or as a complementary approach. Families can benefit from therapy when they experience any stressful event that may strain family relationships, such as financial hardship, divorce, or the death of a loved one. In addition, it can be effective in treating mental health concerns that impact the family as a whole, such as depression, substance abuse, chronic illness, and food issues, or everyday concerns, like communication problems, interpersonal conflict, or behavioral problems in children and adolescents. Family counseling aims to promote understanding and collaboration among family members in order to solve the problems of one or more individuals. <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/modes/family-therapy">Click for more information</a>

		<h3 class="text-center">Canine Assisted Interventions</h3>
		<p>
			Canine-assisted therapy uses dogs to promote health and healing. Like other animals, dogs are accepting, comforting and non-judgmental, making them ideal therapy companions. Therapy dogs undergo extensive training before working with patients.
		</p>
		<p>
			Canine therapy can be immensely healing. Children and teens respond particularly well to canine therapy, developing trust and strong bonds with the animals. Many find it easier to open up and talk when the focus is on the dog. The therapist working with the patient can gain valuable insights by observing the interactions between patients and their canine companions. <a href="https://www.crchealth.com/types-of-therapy/what-is-canine-therapy/">Click for more information</a>

		<h3 class="text-center">ESA Evaluations</h3>
		<p>
			An Emotional Support Animal, or ESA, is an animal that provides therapeutic value to its owner. ESA’s are protected by the Fair Housing Act and Air Carrier Access Act. Emotional Support Animals are not limited to just dogs, but can be applied to any animal. Emotional Support Animals do not have to be trained to perform a specific task. However, they do require a note from a licensed mental health professional. ESA’s are allowed to live in pet free housing and fly in the main cabin of an airplane
		</p>
		<p>
			It is a common misconception that emotional support animals are protected by the American with Disabilities Act. This is in fact not the case. ESA’s do not have the same rights as service dogs.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am qualified to contact formal evaluations to determine eligibility (mental health disability) for an ESA. Due to the lack of regulations around this process, I seek to gain support and standardization through research. I can not provide ESA letters to any of my current therapy clients, as I must separate my clinical and forensic roles.
