		<h3 class="text-center">Individual Psychotherapy</h3>

		<h4 class="blue-text">Psychodynamic therapy</h4>
		<p>
			An in-depth form of talk therapy based on the theories and principles of psychoanalysis. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is equally focused on the patient-therapist relationship and the patient’s relationship with his or her external world. Often, psychodynamic therapy is shorter than psychoanalytic therapy with respect to the frequency and number of sessions, but this is not always the case. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/psychodynamic-therapy">Click for more information</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			It is mostly delivered once per week and takes place face-to-face. Often similar in number of sessions to CBT –  15 sessions would not be unusual. 
		</p>

		<h4 class="tangerine-text">Self-Psychology</h4>
		<p>
			Recognizing empathy as an essential aspect of the therapeutic process of addressing human development and growth.

		<h4 class="blue-text">Discernment Counseling</h4>
		<p>
			A type of brief couples therapy designed for couples who are uncertain about whether to continue or end their relationship.

		<h3 class="text-center">Parent Coaching with Positive Discipline</h3>
		<p>
			Positive Discipline teaches young people from an early age to become responsible, respectful, and resourceful members of their communities. Based on the best-selling Positive Discipline parenting books by child psychologist Dr. Jane Nelsen, Positive Discipline teaches important social and life skills in a manner that is deeply respectful and encouraging for both children and parents. Recent research tells us that children are hardwired from birth to connect with others, and that children who feel a sense of connection to their community, family, and school are less likely to misbehave. Positive Discipline is based on the understanding that the key to positive parenting is not punishment, but mutual respect. <a href="https://www.positivediscipline.com/">Click for more information</a>

		<h3 class="text-center">Family Therapy</h3>
		<p>
			Family therapy or family counseling is designed to address specific issues that affect the psychological health of the family, such as major life transitions or mental health conditions. It may be used as the primary mode of treatment or as a complementary approach. Families can benefit from therapy when they experience any stressful event that may strain family relationships, such as financial hardship, divorce, or the death of a loved one. In addition, it can be effective in treating mental health concerns that impact the family as a whole, such as depression, substance abuse, chronic illness, and food issues, or everyday concerns, like communication problems, interpersonal conflict, or behavioral problems in children and adolescents. Family counseling aims to promote understanding and collaboration among family members in order to solve the problems of one or more individuals. You may choose to invite a family member into one or more of your individual therapy sessions if you would like support with communicating concerns or needs you feel vulnerable about doing on your own. <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/modes/family-therapy">Click for more information</a>
